# typing_speed_test 

we will create a Typing Speed Test Game using Python and Tkinter. This game will help users check how fast they can type in Words Per Minute (WPM) and also measure their typing accuracy. Whether you’re new to Python or have some experience, this project is a fun way to practice coding while improving your typing speed!
Typing is an important skill for everyone who uses computers, whether it’s for coding, writing, or everyday communication. In this article, we will show you how to make a Typing Speed Test Game that calculates your typing speed (WPM) and accuracy based on a text.
The game will help you track your typing performance, making it a great tool for improving your typing speed. We will use Python and Tkinter, which is a built-in library for creating simple graphical interfaces, to build the game. The game will have a basic interface where users can type random text, and it will track how well they do.

Required Modules or Packages:
To build this typing speed test game, you will need the following Python modules:
Tkinter: A built-in library in Python that helps create graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
Time: A Python module used to measure time intervals.
Random: A module used to generate random text for the typing challenge.

If Tkinter is not installed on your system, you can install it using the following command in your terminal:
pip install tk

How to Run the Code:
Follow these steps to run the Typing Speed Test Game on your system:
1)Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2)Install Tkinter using pip (if it’s not already installed).
3)Copy the full code provided below into a Python file (e.g., typing_speed_test.py).
4)Open your terminal or command prompt, go to the folder where the file is saved, and run the file using the command:

python typing_speed_test.py
         
5. The game window will open, and you can start typing the displayed text to test your speed and accuracy.
